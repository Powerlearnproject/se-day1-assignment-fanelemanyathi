#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

1. Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is a branch of computer science that’s all about building, testing, and maintaining software.

It plays a crucial role in making sure software is reliable, efficient, scalable, and secure—especially in high-stakes fields like healthcare and finance.

Some of the biggest priorities in software engineering include making sure programs work as expected without bias, improving the development process, handling high traffic without slowing down, and keeping data safe with security measures like authentication, authorization, and encryption.


2. Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering

The evolution of software engineering has been shaped by a few key turning points. As software systems became bigger and more complex, developers needed better ways to manage them. This led to structured programming, modular design, and object-oriented programming (OOP), making code easier to read, maintain, and collaborate on. 

Then came the need for better project management. Early software development was often chaotic, so formal methods like the Waterfall model, Agile development, and DevOps helped teams stay organized, build software more systematically, and adapt more easily to change.  

Another major shift was making software less dependent on hardware. Early programmers had to write low-level code tailored to specific machines, but high-level languages and operating systems made it possible to focus more on solving problems rather than worrying about hardware details.  

Finally, cloud computing and virtualization took things even further by freeing software from specific physical machines. This made applications more flexible and scalable, shaping the way modern software is built today. These milestones have all played a huge role in making software engineering what it is now—allowing us to create powerful, reliable, and adaptable systems.


3. List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

3.1. Planning – This is where the foundation is set. The team defines the software’s purpose, scope, and objectives to ensure a clear direction for development.

3.2. Requirement Analysis – Developers and stakeholders determine exactly what the end users need, translating their expectations into detailed specifications.

3.3. Design – The software’s structure is mapped out, creating a framework that outlines how different components will interact and function.

3.4. Coding – This is where the actual development happens. Programmers write the code that brings the software to life, following the design blueprint.

3.5. Testing – Before launching, the software goes through rigorous testing to identify and fix any bugs, glitches, or performance issues.
Each step is crucial in ensuring the final 


4. Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall and Agile are two different approaches to software development, each with its own strengths and limitations.  

>Waterfall is a structured, step-by-step process where each phase is completed before moving to the next. This makes it predictable and easy to manage, but it lacks flexibility.Once a phase is finished, changes are difficult to implement. Customer feedback usually comes late, after the entire product is built, and testing happens only at the end. Waterfall is best suited for projects with well-defined requirements that are unlikely to change, such as government systems or aerospace software.  

>Agile takes a more flexible and iterative approach, breaking development into smaller cycles called sprints. Each sprint allows for continuous testing, frequent updates, and regular customer feedback, making it easier to adapt to changing requirements. This approach works well for projects where needs may evolve over time, such as mobile apps, startup products, or customer-driven platforms.  

Waterfall provides stability and clear structure, while Agile allows for rapid changes and ongoing improvements. The right choice depends on the project’s needs and how much flexibility is required.


5. Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

5.1. Software Developer
>Develops applications, programs, and systems using programming languages and frameworks.

>Maintains and updates software to ensure functionality.

>Collaborates with team members to follow best practices in software development.

>Reports progress to the project manager.

5.2. Quality Assurance Engineer

>Collaborates with stakeholders to clarify software requirements.

>Creates development standards and procedures for programmers.

>Ensures software meets requirements before deployment.

>Analyzes products to identify bugs and suggest efficiency improvements.

>Develops and executes automation scripts using open-source tools.

5.3.Project Manager

>Assembles and leads the software development team.

>Discusses project requirements with clients and developers.

>Creates project blueprints.

>Tracks and communicates project milestones.

>Delivers the completed software to clients and monitors its performanc


6. Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is a software platform that aids in creating software applications by providing a space to write, compile, and debug code, often with tools that enhance development. Examples include Visual Studio Code (VSCode).

Importance of IDEs:

>Understands programming language rules, offering intelligent features for code writing and editing.

>Formats code for readability and provides instant feedback on syntax errors.

>Suggests code completions as developers type.

>Automates repetitive coding tasks, improving productivity.

>Compiles code into a format understandable by the operating system.

>Automates unit testing before integration with other developers' code.

>Offers debugging tools to identify and fix errors in real-time.

A Version Control System (VCS) helps manage changes to source code over time. An example is Git.

Importance of VCS:

>Facilitates collaboration among multiple developers on the same codebase without conflicts.

>Tracks changes with detailed history, simplifying analysis.

>Supports branching for new features and merging changes into the main codebase.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

>Rapid Technological Advancement: Engineers must keep current with emerging trends.
>Solution: Embrace continuous learning and agile methodologies to stay adaptable.

>Time Constraints: High pressure to meet tight deadlines.
>Solution: Implement agile methodologies like Scrum to break projects into manageable sprints.

>Limited Infrastructure: Inadequate tools and platforms can hinder performance.
>Solution: Ensure access to robust infrastructure for effective work.

>Changing Software Requirements: Frequent changes complicate design and development.
>Solution: Use agile development and modular design to enable flexibility and adaptability.

>Software Security: Developing secure software is complex.
>Solution: Research security measures against various threats.

>Software Accessibility and Usability: Overly complex software can confuse users.
>Solution: Focus on scalable architecture and reliability.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

>Unit Tests: Test individual methods and functions of components, ensuring they work correctly in isolation.

>Integration Tests: Verify that different modules or services function well together, ensuring smooth data flow and interface compatibility.

>System Testing: Evaluates the entire software system, checking that it meets all functional and non-functional requirements, including performance and security.

>Acceptance Tests: Formal tests to verify that the system satisfies business requirements, simulating user behaviors to confirm readiness for deployment.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt Engineering is the process of guiding generative AI models to produce desired outputs.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Vague Prompt: Write a story about a dog.

Improved Prompt: Write a short story about a golden retriever named Max who gets lost in the woods during a camping trip and must find his way back to his owner, a young boy named Alex, while encountering various animals and overcoming obstacles along the way.

Why the Improved Prompt is More Effective:

Specificity: Clearly identifies the type of dog and its name, making it easier to visualize the character.

Context: Establishes a setting (woods during a camping trip) that adds depth to the story.

Plot Direction: Outlines a specific challenge (getting lost) that provides a clear narrative arc and opportunities for character development.
