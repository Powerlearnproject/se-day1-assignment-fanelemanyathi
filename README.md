#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

1. Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is a branch of computer science that’s all about building, testing, and maintaining software.

It plays a crucial role in making sure software is reliable, efficient, scalable, and secure—especially in high-stakes fields like healthcare and finance.

Some of the biggest priorities in software engineering include making sure programs work as expected without bias, improving the development process, handling high traffic without slowing down, and keeping data safe with security measures like authentication, authorization, and encryption.


2. Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering

The evolution of software engineering has been shaped by a few key turning points. As software systems became bigger and more complex, developers needed better ways to manage them. This led to structured programming, modular design, and object-oriented programming (OOP), making code easier to read, maintain, and collaborate on. 

Then came the need for better project management. Early software development was often chaotic, so formal methods like the Waterfall model, Agile development, and DevOps helped teams stay organized, build software more systematically, and adapt more easily to change.  

Another major shift was making software less dependent on hardware. Early programmers had to write low-level code tailored to specific machines, but high-level languages and operating systems made it possible to focus more on solving problems rather than worrying about hardware details.  

Finally, cloud computing and virtualization took things even further by freeing software from specific physical machines. This made applications more flexible and scalable, shaping the way modern software is built today. These milestones have all played a huge role in making software engineering what it is now—allowing us to create powerful, reliable, and adaptable systems.


3. List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Planning – This is where the foundation is set. The team defines the software’s purpose, scope, and objectives to ensure a clear direction for development.

Requirement Analysis – Developers and stakeholders determine exactly what the end users need, translating their expectations into detailed specifications.

Design – The software’s structure is mapped out, creating a framework that outlines how different components will interact and function.

Coding – This is where the actual development happens. Programmers write the code that brings the software to life, following the design blueprint.

Testing – Before launching, the software goes through rigorous testing to identify and fix any bugs, glitches, or performance issues.
Each step is crucial in ensuring the final 


4. Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall and Agile are two different approaches to software development, each with its own strengths and limitations.  

Waterfall is a structured, step-by-step process where each phase is completed before moving to the next. This makes it predictable and easy to manage, but it lacks flexibility. Once a phase is finished, changes are difficult to implement. Customer feedback usually comes late, after the entire product is built, and testing happens only at the end. Waterfall is best suited for projects with well-defined requirements that are unlikely to change, such as government systems or aerospace software.  

Agile takes a more flexible and iterative approach, breaking development into smaller cycles called sprints. Each sprint allows for continuous testing, frequent updates, and regular customer feedback, making it easier to adapt to changing requirements. This approach works well for projects where needs may evolve over time, such as mobile apps, startup products, or customer-driven platforms.  

Waterfall provides stability and clear structure, while Agile allows for rapid changes and ongoing improvements. The right choice depends on the project’s needs and how much flexibility is required.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
